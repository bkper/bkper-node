[Bkper REST API]: https://bkper.com/docs/#rest-api-enabling

A **command line** utility to create and update [Bkper Apps and Bots](https://bkper.com/docs/) as well as to start the [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to support AI assistants and agents to interact with your Bkper books.

## Installation

### Add the package:

```
npm i bkper
```
or
```
yarn add bkper
```
or
```
bun add bkper
```

Optionally, you can install it globally to be able to use the ```bkper``` command line utility:

```
npm i -g bkper
```
or
```
yarn global add bkper
```

## Commands

- ```login```   - Logs the user in. Saves the client credentials to a ```~/.bkper-credentials.json``` file.
- ```logout```  - Logs out the user by deleting client credentials.
- ```mcp start``` - Start the Bkper MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.
- ```app -c```  - Create a new App based on ```./bkperapp.yaml``` file.
- ```app -u```  - Update an existing App based on ```./bkperapp.yaml``` file.

### Examples
```
npm bkper login
```
```
yarn bkper login
```

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server

Bkper includes an MCP server that allows AI assistants and other tools to interact with your Bkper books through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

#### Starting the MCP Server

```bash
bkper mcp start
```

The server runs on stdio and provides the following tools:

- **list_books** - List all books accessible by the authenticated user
- **get_book** - Get details of a specific book by ID
- **get_balances** - Get account balances for a specific date or period
- **list_transactions** - List transactions with filtering options

#### Prerequisites

Before using the MCP server:
1. Login using `bkper login` to set up authentication
2. Enable the [Bkper REST API]
3. Ensure the `BKPER_API_KEY` environment variable is set.

The MCP server uses the same authentication as the CLI, reading credentials from `~/.bkper-credentials.json`.

#### Integration Examples

##### Claude Desktop

Add to your configuration file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bkper": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["bkper", "mcp", "start"],
      "env": {
        "BKPER_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### Other MCP Clients

For other MCP-compatible clients, configure them to run:
```bash
BKPER_API_KEY=your-api-key npx bkper mcp start
```

The server communicates via stdio, so any MCP client that supports stdio transport can connect to it.

#### Available MCP Tools

Once connected, the MCP client can:
- List your Bkper books
- Get account balances for any date or period
- Search and filter transactions
- Analyze your financial data

## Apps and Bots

### Environment Variables
The following environment variable is necessary in order to communicate with the [Bkper REST API]:

```
BKPER_API_KEY=XXXX
```

The ```app``` command also uses the following variables in order to perform App create/update operations:

```
BKPER_CLIENT_SECRET=YYYY
BKPER_USER_EMAILS="someone@gmail.com anotherone@altrostat.com"
BKPER_DEVELOPER_EMAIL=somedeveloer@mycompany.com
```

You can add a ```.env``` file at the root of your project with those variables and bkper will automatically load from it. 
Follow [these](https://bkper.com/docs/#rest-api-enabling) steps in order to configure a valid Bkper API key.

> WARNING: Never upload variables to the source code repository.
